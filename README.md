# Test Driven Development Practice Project

A school Project for rehearsing unit testing with [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/).

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your machine.
2. Go into the project's root directory, and run the command 'npm install'.
3. Run the test swite using the command 'npm test'.

If the command 'npm test' does not work, you may need to install mocha globally on your machine. Do this with the command 'npm install -g mocha'.

## What we learned working on this project

- I learned how to use Chai's assertion syntax for unit tests.
